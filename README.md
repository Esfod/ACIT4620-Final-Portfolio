### Prerequisites
For a fully functioning fuzzy logic system with `skfuzzy`, ensure the following Python packages are installed to be able to run this project (for Python 3.8 or later) :

1. `scipy`: For mathematical operations like membership function calculations.
2. `networkx`: For fuzzy rule graph management.
3. `numpy`: For numerical operations.
4. `matplotlib`: For visualisation (optional, for plotting membership functions).

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-fuzzy scipy networkx
```

### Required Imports
```bash
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from datetime import datetime
import skfuzzy as fuzz
from skfuzzy import control as ctrl
import scikit-fuzzy
from typing import List
```

### 1. Set Up the Environment
Ensure all provided Python scripts are in the same directory and environment.

### 2. Run the _insert script_
